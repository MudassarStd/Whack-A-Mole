when move from start game to game screen, need to update game state to :isActive = true


if (isActive), launch timer

on each user press on mole, update state :score

on bg press, stop game -> stop timer, show game over screen with score board from state,

display moles periodically at different places

take random position, just compose image for that position not others.

check current position, if matches, compose, other wise skip

create a local state to track changes of mole display randomization

Randomization Flow:
first enter in list with initial random pos (we could use local state as that pos and update that local state to create recompositions)
then call randomizer
randomizer will delay for (n:time) and then raise an event that will update local state pos
this local state update will cause a recomposition

================= Further ideas for game =======================

can extend grid size based on user input (3x3, 6x6, 9x9)


================= Bug ===================

- state in viewmodel could not be updated or read
- mole is just shifting horizontally in single row
